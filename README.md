Chatbots have been around for years, but it's only with the advent of LLMs and vector databases that it's been possible for most people to create high quality chatbots that provide a pleasant user experience. In this project, you'll build on your skills with GPT, Pinecone and LangChain to create a chatbot that answers questions about research papers. You'll make use of retrieval augmented generation, and learn how to combine this with conversational memory to hold a conversation with the chatbot.
